Programing to automae the infra now a days
we can do with the sell script as well but its very complex and can't reusable
large shell script converted in terraform simple and readable 

Types of iac tools
-----------------
1>Configuration management(ansible, puppet, chef, saltsstack)
2>Server template (docker, packer, vegrant)
3>Provisoning tools: (terraform, Cloud formation)

Terraform: 
deploy immutable infra resource
servers, db, network ..etc
Multiple providers for all major cloud

Why is terrafomr?
Free and open source by hashicorp
single binary easy to install and use in minutes
Multiple platform on both public and private (physical machine, vmware, aws, gcp, Azure) this can be arcive by providers
providers help to manage third party tools with api

uses hcl : hashicorp configuration language
all fils ends with tf
declaritive : infra is as per the code


3 phases: init/plan/apply
init: intialise the project and identofy and download the neccesary providers
plan: draft a planto get to the target state
apply: make changes to bring the desired state

*if ay thing is missed will create only that object

Resource:
every object that terraform manages eg: db, ec2, db, network on physical server as well
manages life cycle provisining -- configuring -- decommisioning
record the state of the infra  based on this it will react for applying new changes
ensure that infra is in desired state , state file is the blue print

**Terraform can read the attributes of the existin infrastructure by using the data sources****
**can import other reources created manually or by other tools into that control and mange them going forward



Installing Terraform:
------------------
can download from terraform.io
mv terrafrom /usr/local/bin
>>>>>>>>>>terraform version

HCL files to update the configuraton files with tf extention

Resource : object terraform manages it could be afile,machine, data base, users... etc


Terraformplanout put:
+ to create new
- to destroy the resources
-/+ : recreteing the file

Terraform is immutable:eg if we crete a local file and after that we need to chagent h permiison again then tf willl delete that and recreate the new

How to update and destroy the resource??

terraform apply >> to make or update the changes
terraform destroy >> to remove all the things from terraform
