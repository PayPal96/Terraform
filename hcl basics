HCL : hasicorp configuration language

consists of block and arguments
block in {}
inside black key value pairs to represent configuration data

<block> <parameter> {
  key = value
  }
  
what is the block:
infermation about platform and set of resource with in tht platform we want to reate


resource "local_file" "pet" {
      filename = "/root/../pets.txt"
      content = "some text...,"
}

resource = block name
local_file = resource type (local = provider, file = Resource type)
pet = Reource Name
file name andcontent are the arguments 
 
Each rousrce type has specific arguments they expect that we can not change

above : file name and cntent are expecteed by local file we can not change

eg for aws rsource


resource "aws_instance" "test" {
  ami = "ami..."
  intance_type = "t2.micro"
 }
 
 
 
 resource "aws_s3_bucket" "test" {
  bucket = "webserver-bucket"
  acl = "private"
 }
 
 
 
 
 work floe : 4 steps
 
 1> terrafomr init to get the plugins ready
 2> write the configuration files
 3> reiew by terraform plan
 4>apply changes with terraform apply
