Terraform is an Iac tool (infrastructure as code) that allows you build, change and versio of the infrastructure safely and cleanly

Command to check the terraform version
-------------------------------------
terraform version



Important iles in terraform:
----------------------------
1> Main.tf  2> Variables.tf   3>Output.tf


Main.tf is the main file in terraform it has few sections like 

>>Provider Section:::
---------------------


provide "aws" {
        access_key = #${var.aws_acess_key}"
        secret_key = "${var.aws_secret_key}"
        region = "${vars.aws_region}"
       }
       
       > If provider is aws that means we are telling that all the things to be executed in "AWS"
       > Terraform download the necessary plugins based upn the provider type
       
       
Resource section:::
-------------------

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
              ami = 'aminxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
              instance_type = 't1.micro'
              }

Syntax:   resource "instnace type" "name of the instance" { }

First item is the type of the resource we are creating and the second one is name 
is the second one is default then we can give the name in the tags section

EG:

  resource "aws-instance" "default" {
                ami = 'amixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
                instnace-type = 't2.micro"
                 tags {
                    Name = "${var.vpc_name}"
                    }
                    }
                    
                    
                    
 
 
 
 Variables.tf >> all the variable realted data filled in variables.tf
 once we are ready with Main.tf and variables.tf then we can execute the below commands 
 >> terrafrom init
 
 It wil down load the required binaries for the selected provider, After this execute the below cpmmand
 
 >>terraform plan
 
 It will shows that what all are the thing going to be executing with this tf files
 
 Terraform plan command will run the main.tf first and then if there are any var in that wil search for variables.tf
 
Terraform plan >> output will display the things what all are the things going to be created in green colour



Main command in terraform is 
>>terraform apply

This will apply the changes we seen in the output of terraform plan
 Note: terrafom apply command will create a files called "state file" which contains all the infermation aboiut the infra we created through the terraform
 if this file was corrupted terraform will loss the data 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
terraform plan Output: displays the below parmaeters
1> add (number of items) 2> change 3> Destroy


Terraform apply command will ask or approvals while executing the command to bypass it use the below command

>> terraform apply -auto--approve

will display complete output on the screen

After terraform appky command terraform will search for the state file and look into it for configurations
if it find any existing objects or resources then it skip to recreat or duplicate it
if there is no diff in the state file it will show that infra is up to date
if the state file is corrupted then terraform will recreate the resource again which will cause the duplications


**********state file name = terraform.tfstate



Terraform tf vars and work space:
--------------------------------

***Proiding variables in variables.tf is not used in real time bcz every time we need to change the variables..tf file
>> alternative for this is using the tfvars

In tfvars we can use the different files for every enf like prod.tfvars and test.tfvars like this with out altering the variables.tf every time

Work floe with tfvars

Main.tf -------- variables.tf ------------- prod.tfvars/test.tfvars

tfvars file format is "key=value"

**Note**: variable names in the variable.tf must match with the variables in tfvars file
command to excute the terraform with the tfvars file

terraform plan --var-file test.tfvars
terraform apply --var-file test.tfvars

Out::
-----

This parameter will save the plan output
terraform plan --var-file prod.tfvars -out prodplan

the above comand will stoer the plan in prodplan  and we can excute this by the command
terraform apply "prodplan"

Usage: if any changes were done planning this those were delete while applying this plan and recreated the infa as per the plan

***Important Note:

After running prod plan incase we need to run the same infra in test with different test.tfvars then terraform check that in terraform  state file and delete the old ones which 
are in prd bcz the things are different in state file naming conention so it will delete the old ones

It will do PROD to test for all the object

How to overcome this ???

Solution1: Make a copy of terraform stat file and run the plan for terraform test plan

Solution2: Work Space


How to detroy by taking input from a specific tfvars file??
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terraform destroy --var-file prod.tfvars



Work Space:
-----------

to list the work spaces 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terrafrom workspace list

by deafault we will be in deafault workspace shown as *


how to create a work space
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terraform workspace new prod

how to switch to the new workspace
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terraform workspace select prod

By default after creating the workspace you will be in the same work space

So for test and prod we can create 2 work spaces superatly to main the same configuration in both the env

step1> Create2worskspaces prod and test
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terraform workspace new prod


step2> switch to speific work space and apply the changes with prodtfvars
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terraform apply -var-fileprod.tfvars


step3> Ceck the state file in terroform folder structure
tis time we will see a directory instead of a file as >>terraform.tfstate.d inside that directory we could see the directories with the names of workspaces 
ans contain state files in it



how to run the terraform state file and display the output??
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>terraform show
it will run the state file in the work space it has mentioned
